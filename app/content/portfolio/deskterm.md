## Description

DeskTerm turns a desktop in a Gnome3 shell on Debian based Linux operating systems into a terminal. It uses Devils Pie to  
manipulate an instance of the gnome-shell to overlay the desktop. I chose to write it in Lua because that's the language  
Devils Pie uses. I also wrote an installer for it in bash.

## Technologies Used

* [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) - Shell scripting
* [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) - Programming language
* [Devils Pie 2](http://www.gusnan.se/devilspie2/) - Window manipulation software

## What I Learned

I learned what little bit of Lua I know, and had a bunch of fun writing the simple bash installer. This is also my first  
Linux program, aside from web servers :\).
