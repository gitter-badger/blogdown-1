## Description

[ReactGantt](https://github.com/jamrizzi/react-gantt) is simply a gantt chart for react. I created this because I could  
not find any Gantt charts that were flexible enough for my needs. After publishing this component, I was surprised how  
many people found it useful. I plan on adding more features to this plugin and extending more support in the future.
