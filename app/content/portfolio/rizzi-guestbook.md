## What I Learned

This was the first WordPress plugin I created, so I learned a lot about the WordPress plugin API. I specifically learned
how to use the WordPress comment filter, since the WordPress commenting system is what powers the Guestbook. I also
learned how to save and access WordPress options. Aside from experience with WordPress plugin development, I gained
experience using Google's No Captcha reCaptcha.
